# Facial-Recognition-Through-A-IPWebcam
Hey there, I am working on Facial Recognition for my college annual project submission. I try to integrate my project with IPWebcam so that i can get a vedio feed from my smartphone and then I forward it to my python script.
You just need to install a IPWebcam application in your smartphone and open it on Desktop/PC through the IP address provided in the IPwebcam. Open that IP on your system browser and see if it working right or not. After all that you just need to put an extension in the URL which you during the IPwebcam vedio feed in your browser. And that extension is shot.jpg.
After that, copy the whole URL and paste in the Main.py which is present in my repo. There is a URL option in the code , paste it there.
Now Create a folder with name Images in the same folder where this is present.
Add some of your images and rename it to 1.jpg,2.jpg and so on.
Every Person images must have a different in the images folder and name of the folder in which the images of a particular person is added, must be name of the person.
That all the setup process.
Now Run Faces-train.py file. It will train your data which is provided by you.
And Now run the Main.py file and check the results.
