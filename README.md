# Facial-Recognition-Through-A-IPWebcam
## `Hey there` 

I am working on Facial Recognition for my college annual project submission. I try to integrate my project with IPWebcam so that i can get a vedio feed from my smartphone and then I forward it to my python script.<br>

### `Installation`

1) You just need to install a IPWebcam application in your smartphone and open it on Desktop/PC through the IP address provided in the IPwebcam.<br>

2) Open that IP on your system browser and see if it working right or not.<br>
3) After all that you just need to put an extension in the URL which you during the IPwebcam vedio feed in your browser. And that extension is shot.jpg.<br>
4) After that, copy the whole URL and paste in the Main.py which is present in my repo. There is a URL option in the code , paste it there.<br>
5) Now Create a folder with name Images in the same folder where this is present.<br>
6) Add some of your images and rename it to 1.jpg,2.jpg and so on.<br>
7) Every Person images must have a different in the images folder and name of the folder in which the images of a particular person is added, must be name of the person.
That all the setup process.<br>

### `Run`
1) Now Run Faces-train.py file. It will train your data which is provided by you.<br>
2) And Now run the Main.py file and check the results.<br>
